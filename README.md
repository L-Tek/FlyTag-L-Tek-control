# FlyTag-L-Tek-control

The idea:
The idea of this project will encourage people to make their homes more smart and more secure, to offer comfort and protection in their homes.

The project:
This is a stand alone project, meaning no internet connection is required for a minimum operation.

The concept:
- the project is showing how easy is to control and stay connected Flytag with Raspberry PI 3 over the bluetooth
- how to control LED's wirelessly					            -> useful for notifications, alarms, warnings
- how to control servo motor wirelessly			       	-> useful for movements surveillance camera angle
- how to read sensor data from FlyTag			  	       -> useful for monitoring ambient conditions (temperature, humidity, luminosity, ...)
- how to read analog value from Flytag wirelessly	-> useful for measurements analog value or additional sensors
- how to control relay wirelessly			            		-> useful fo controlling system

Things used in this project:
- Raspberry PI 3 (http://si.farnell.com/raspberry-pi/raspberrypi-modb-1gb/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/dp/2525225)
- FlyTag FF1502 Sensor BLE (Firmware revision: FlyTag_v1.1.S.zip) (https://firefly-iot.com/product/ff1502-sensor-ble/)
If Flytag FF1502 has different firmware version, please see how to reprogram it: https://firefly-iot.com/firefly-flytag-firmware-update-ota/
